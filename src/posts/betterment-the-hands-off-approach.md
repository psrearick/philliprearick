If you have not started investing yet, now is the time. It is the only way to secure your financial future. You hear it always: the earlier you invest, the better. So, why don't people do it? Because it is difficult, complex, and time-consuming. Investing has a high barrier to entry, and financial advisors want to keep it that way. If you are in this position, you know you need to invest but have not started; where do you begin?

## Wealth Managers
The traditional advice is to let someone else manage your funds. Portfolio management is incredibly complex and best left to professionals. Wealth managers will argue that it takes someone with training and expertise to outperform the market. While that is true, most wealth managers underperform the market. They are unlikely to do better than the market, but they will charge you a minimum of 1% to try! In addition, most wealth managers do not have your best interest in mind (but let's leave that for another article). Many others are scammers. How do you avoid these people and find legitimate, honest advisors who, after fees, will outperform the market? I have no idea.

## DIY Financial Freedom
If you do not like the idea of trusting a stranger with your money who is likely to lose it, you have options. The first is the DIY method, whereby you manage every aspect of your portfolio. To do this, you would:

* Analyze your financial goals
* determine a diverse, non-correlated asset allocation that is consistent with your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon
* Find funds that match your desired asset allocation
* invest in each one at the allocation weights you decided on
* Annually rebalance your investments back to your original allocation
* Adjust your allocation as you get closer to your goals

This method is the best option to minimize fees and maximize returns. It sounds like a lot of work. And, to be honest, it is a lot of work. It is not insurmountable and does not require you to be a genius or have formal training in finance. This strategy is the path I would suggest if you have the time to dedicate to it and the interest and motivation to maintain it. There are many reasons that this path may not be the best method for you. So, where does that leave you? It leaves you in the loving arms of your friendly, trustworthy Robo-Advisors.

## Robo-Advisors
Robo-Advisors are digital platforms that provide algorithm-driven financial planning services. The application will request various details from you to determine the best way to invest your money to meet your goals. You set up an account and fund it; then, the platform will purchase investments according to your specifications for a small fee. It will also handle rebalancing your portfolio and adjusting the allocation as you approach your goals. While this is more expensive than managing your portfolio, it is much cheaper than paying a financial advisor. The two most popular Robo-advisors, Wealthfront and Betterment, are both 0.25% annually, and asset management by a traditional financial advisor is, on average, 1% annually. So, you pay four times as much and likely end up with worse results. While Wealthfront is a popular Robo-advisor with similar offerings to Betterment, I do not have experience with that platform. For this reason, if the DIY method does not fit your lifestyle or interest level, I recommend investigating Betterment.

## Betterment
### History
The idea behind Betterment, something that tells you what to do with your money and then does it, came from Jon Stein, a Columbia Business School MBA graduate. He began to compose his original team with Sean Owen, a Google software engineer, who created the technological base for the platform. He became the company's CTO. They brought on Eli Broverman, an entrepreneurial securities attorney who would become the President of Betterment, to handle the legal side of the business. Polina Khentov, a graphic designer and Jon's wife, then girlfriend, designed the interface. They partnered with the serial entrepreneur Ryan O'Sullivan to help them set up a broker-dealer. Sean, Eli, Ryan, and Jon founded Betterment LLC in August 2008. In 2009, a former colleague of Jon, Anthony Schrauth, joined as the chief product officer. The same year Kiran Keshav, who ran Columbia University's Center for Computational Biology, took over for Sean as Sean moved on to become the Director of Data Science at Cloudera, focusing on machine learning. Setting up a broker-dealer and gaining approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) was a two-year process. After those two years of further development, this team launched the product on May 26, 2010, at the first-ever TechCrunch Disrupt, the most influential technology conference in the country. The launch was a huge success. Betterment now handles over $33 billion of assets across 700,000 customer accounts.

### Principles
Betterment centers its approach around five principles that drive its recommendations.

#### Personalization
The algorithm's most important criteria are your goals and circumstances, so it asks you what you want to do and when you want to do it. They can help you figure this out by looking at various factors in your life, such as your income, where you live, and your tax bracket.

#### Automation
The platform makes it easy to automate deposits and be a disciplined investor. It also automates the tedious and time-consuming parts of the investment process.

#### Diversification
Betterment reduces your risk by investing in a diverse range of low-cost ETFs tracking indices across several asset classes and markets. It bases diversification and risk management on your personal goals and risk tolerance.

#### Low Fees
Betterment drops the 1% minimum advisor fee down to  0.25%, which may not sound like a lot, but quadrupling your prices adds up in the long term. Additionally, Betterment does not charge more fees for rebalancing and allocation adjustments.

#### Tax Management
The most complicated part of investing is appropriately handling your investments to reduce taxes. Betterment can automatically implement strategies such as tax-loss harvesting to protect your capital and wisely manage taxes.

### Process
The process for getting started is straightforward. You start by signing up for an account, and some introductory emails will help you get started and verify your email address. From there, you can start building your portfolio.

Betterment allows you to create multiple "accounts" for various goals. Creating an account will take you through a questionnaire to determine the best type and asset allocation to use. You are in complete control of these factors, but, more often than not, their suggestions are what you should use. After this selection, you can link a bank account and make regular transfers or a one-time deposit to start your fund. After the few days it takes to complete the transfer, Betterment will purchase the ETFs according to your specifications. You will be free to change your asset allocation and other account settings anytime. Aside from adding more funds later, you have done all you need to invest.

### Platform
The Betterment website and app are both extremely user-friendly. They allow you to dig into the specifics of your account, holdings, allocation, and the platform's decisions. They provide enough detail to understand what is going on without feeling overwhelmed. The interface is simple and shows you precisely what you want to see on the dashboard. You'll find plenty of charts once you start navigating the website, which makes it easier to understand your investments. Tools also help you see how potential changes impact your portfolio's outlook. Additionally, they offer excellent customer service and a wealth of help documentation to explain the application's details and process. The platform is very well designed and makes anything you need to do incredibly simple.

## Application of Concepts
If you are looking for a simple, hands-off approach to investing that still gives excellent returns, Betterment is the solution. If you want to be in control of your investments, making your calculations, allocations, and transactions, Betterment will seem to limit you. There are plenty of great reasons why you would want to have greater control in managing your investments than Betterment can offer. If these apply to you, I would suggest checking out [M1 Finance](https://m1.com). However, if you want something you can set up once and let it handle the rest for you, consider Betterment. Of course, you can use both, as well. Let Betterment take care of short-term investments for some goals, such as a car or house purchase, while handling your retirement funds yourself. It's up to you to decide how you want to use the tools available. Regardless of your choice, the sooner you start investing, the better.
