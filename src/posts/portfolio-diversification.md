Traditional investment advice is that you need to have a diverse portfolio. Diversity is the key is a resilient portfolio and secure financial future. Is this good advice? What does it mean? How does it apply to you?

## Asset Allocation
Asset allocation is the specific distribution of asset types in your investment portfolio. When investing, you are spending money on things you hope will increase in value, which you will sell later. These "things" are assets. There are several different types of assets, or asset classes, each having two primary characteristics you care about: risk and return. While you are hoping your investments will increase in value, there is a possibility that they will instead decrease in value. This possibility is the risk the asset carries, whereas the change in the asset's value is its return. The ratio between an asset's risk and return is crucial to understand. The goal of optimizing this ratio, maximizing the returns while minimizing risk, is achieved using diversification.

## Diversification
As a general rule, different asset classes offer various risks and returns; the greater the chance of an asset's failure, the greater its potential return. While everyone wants huge returns, going after them may result in huge losses. Targeting low-risk holdings while avoiding the losses of high-risk assets will significantly limit the upside potential. The way to achieve something in between is to invest part of your portfolio in high-risk investments and low-risk assets. This practice is diversification. Let's look at which types of investments are available to you.

## Asset Classes
Before you can start dividing up your money, you need to know where you can put that money. A diverse portfolio holds positions in several asset classes (groupings of assets with similar characteristics). There are four primary asset classes, each comprising various asset types or subclasses: defensive assets, equities, fixed-income, and alternative investments.

#### Defensive Assets
Defensive assets are securities that you can easily convert into cash. These investments include cash and cash equivalents, money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills, certificates of deposits (CDs), bank checking accounts, and savings accounts. These offer the highest level of stability, liquidity, and flexibility, and they also provide the lowest returns.

#### Equities
Equities are also known as stocks. They are portions of ownership in a company, and each piece is called a share. A wide range of factors can impact equity's growth. Equities have a higher potential return than the other asset classes; however, they also carry greater risk. In addition to increasing in value, many stocks also provide dividends. These are rewards a company pays its shareholders for investing in the company.

#### Fixed Income
Fixed-income securities are loans that are broken into units and sold. Investors provide the capital for a specific number of loan parts and receive interest payments on the provided money. These securities, also known as bonds, have a predetermined maturity date at which the agency that took the loan repays the principal capital. Bonds can provide money to the government as well as corporations. These securities provide a predictable income. While they have slightly more volatility than cash and slightly greater returns, they are generally considered safe investments.

#### Alterative Investments
Finally, we have the asset class that encompasses all other types of securities. Examples of alternative investments are real estate, precious metals, cryptocurrency, digital assets, art, and peer-to-peer loans, which carry a wide range of risks and returns.

## Correlation and the Importance of Diversification
With a better understanding of what asset classes are available, it is essential to know how they interact with each other. Some asset classes are more tightly-coupled than others. If one asset class changes in value and another asset class frequently mirrors that change, they have a high correlation. If the two asset classes move independently, they have a low correlation. When one asset class moves up, and another often moves down, they are negatively correlated. An example of a negative correlation would be stocks and treasury bonds. Treasury bonds often grow most when the stock market is down, and they grow least when it is up.

Correlation is significant to consider when choosing an asset allocation. The best way to mitigate risk is by investing in multiple asset classes. But, if those classes are closely correlated, the added diversity may be helping less than you want. To limit risk, you should have the most significant portions of your portfolio have the most negligible correlation.

Below is a table with asset classes and their correlations with each other. This table will help see how asset classes are correlated. The closer the value is to one, the greater the correlation is between the asset classes.

The correlation table shows us that asset classes are impacted by one another, yet they move independently. There is a high correlation between international stocks and U.S. stocks. REITs are also closely correlated with U.S. stocks, whereas corporate bonds and U.S. treasury bonds have very low correlations with U.S. stocks and a moderate correlation with each other. Let's look at how you use this data to allocate your funds.

## How Much Diversification Do You Need?
There is no optimal allocation for everyone; asset allocation depends on your goals. If you need your money soon, you'll likely want to pick lower-risk assets than if you do not need your money for a long time. Another factor to consider is how tolerant you are of risk - the less you can tolerate, the safer assets you should select.

U.S. stocks are high-risk, high-return assets, while U.S. corporate bonds are low-risk, low-return. Given the minimal correlation between the two asset classes, adding additional diversification provides little optimization and will likely decrease your returns. For this reason, it makes the most sense to stick with just those two asset classes.

Some people suggest adding international stocks to balance the risk of U.S. stocks, but I do not much benefit from this. The correlation table revealed that asset classes operate independently. If one asset class is doing poorly, diversity helps smooth things out until it turns around. However, this only works for asset classes that have a low correlation. If the U.S. stock market is doing poorly, having a high percentage of your portfolio in international stocks will not help as much as in corporate bonds because global and U.S. stocks are highly correlated. This correlation is likely because the biggest companies on the U.S. stock market are international companies with heavy influence in foreign economies. So adding global stocks does not increase diversification; however, it does increase volatility as international stocks are less stable than U.S. stocks.

You can do very well by only holding shares in a low-cost ETF of the U.S. stock market, such as VTI, and a low-cost ETF of the U.S. bond market, such as BND. Holding those two ETFs in a balance that suits your risk tolerance can give excellent results.

## Robo-Advisors
Managing your portfolio is a great skill; it puts you in control of your finances and gives you confidence that your money is where it should be. However, it is time-consuming. Once you have put in the time to determine the best funds to buy and make your purchases, you will need to return to your portfolio and make adjustments periodically. You do most of the work upfront, but you must review your portfolio and make adjustments every 6-12 months.

An alternative is to use a Robo-advisor. The two most popular tools are [Wealthfront](https://wealthfront.com) and [Betterment](https://betterment.com). These are digital platforms that provide algorithm-driven financial planning services. The application will request various details from you to determine the best way to invest your money to meet your goals. You set up an account and fund it; then, the platform will purchase investments according to your specifications for a small fee. While this is more expensive than managing your portfolio, it is much cheaper than paying a financial advisor. I have used Betterment. It is a solid application I would recommend to anyone who does not want to control everything. If you want to save money on financial services and have greater control over your finances, you need to select a broker the make your transactions. [M1 Finance](https://m1.com) is an excellent option for this method.
