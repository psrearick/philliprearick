Asset allocation is the specific distribution of asset types in your investment portfolio. When investing, you are spending money on things you hope will increase in value, which you will sell later. These "things" are assets. There are several different types of assets, or asset classes, each having two primary characteristics you care about: risk and return.

Before you can start dividing up your money, you need to know where you can put that money. A wide range of asset classes can be categorized in two primary ways: type and function. For example, by classifying by type, you can group all asset classes related to stocks together as "equities." Categorizing by functionality, you can put growth stocks (stocks that hold with the intention of them increasing in value) into a "growth" category and your dividend stocks (stocks that pay you money for having them) into an "income" category. Both categorization methods are helpful. So we will start by looking at the asset classes from a broader perspective, the general types. Then we will look at them in more detail, categorized by function.

## General Asset Class Types
There are four primary asset classes, each comprising various asset types or subclasses: defensive assets, equities, fixed-income, and alternative investments.

#### Defensive Assets
Defensive assets are securities that you can easily convert into cash. These investments include cash and cash equivalents, money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills, certificates of deposits (CDs), bank checking accounts, and savings accounts. These offer the highest level of stability, liquidity, and flexibility, and they also provide the lowest returns.

#### Equities
Equities are also known as stocks. They are portions of ownership in a company, and each piece is called a share. A wide range of factors can impact equity's growth. Equities have a higher potential return than the other asset classes; however, they also carry greater risk. In addition to increasing in value, many stocks also provide dividends. These are rewards a company pays its shareholders for investing in the company.

#### Fixed Income
Fixed-income securities are loans that are broken into units and sold. Investors provide the capital for a specific number of loan parts and receive interest payments on the provided money. These securities, also known as bonds, have a predetermined maturity date at which the agency that took the loan repays the principal capital. Bonds can provide money to the government as well as corporations. These securities provide a predictable income. While they have slightly more volatility than cash and slightly greater returns, they are generally considered safe investments.

#### Alterative Investments
Finally, we have the asset class that encompasses all other types of securities. Examples of alternative investments are real estate, precious metals, cryptocurrency, digital assets, art, and peer-to-peer loans, which carry a wide range of risks and returns.

## Specific Asset Class Functions
Within these asset classes are several types of assets. When researching diversification, you frequently see people expressing their portfolio as a ratio of stocks to bonds. Even if you stick exclusively to these asset classes (equities and fixed-income), how do you know which stocks and bonds to purchase? Let's break the asset classes into smaller collections of assets that we can group by function to help identify which to buy and how to use them.

#### Defensive
Defensive assets are investments we expect to underperform when the stock market rises. However, these assets have a low, and sometimes inverse, correlation with the stock market. That means that moves in the stock market have little impact on defensive assets. If the stock market is under pressure, it may not affect the assets or perform better. These are not guaranteed to preserve your capital; however, they are the safest way to protect it and limit volatility.

**cash and cash investments** offer the highest stability, liquidity, and flexibility. They are most helpful if you need your money soon and offer meager returns that change with interest rates and inflation. Examples are checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposits (CDs), cash in brokerage accounts, and money in a purchased money fund.

**U.S. Treasury Securities** such as Treasury notes and Treasury bonds are highly safe and among the highest credit-quality investments available. They pay interest, and the U.S. government backs their principal and interest payments. They come in various maturity ranges, so they can provide diversity and security to a portfolio while allowing the opportunity to use that money at a specific time.

**International Developed-Country Bonds** offer geographic and currency diversification and income potential. They are more volatile than U.S. Treasury securities but remain stable and defensive.

**Gold and Other Precious Metals** are used to protect against sharp declines in the stock market or extreme cases of inflation. Financial system instability often results in investors buying gold. While the assets are defensive, they still have price volatility and are a terrible option if you need cash at a specific time.

#### Inflation Protection
Inflation protection is a method to diversify your portfolio and minimize the negative impact inflation can have on the value of your portfolio. These investments are not guaranteed to beat inflation but offer protection against it, and they may decrease in price if deflation occurs.

**U.S. Inflation Protected Bonds** are Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) and are used to protect against rising inflation. When the bonds mature, they pay the greater of the original principal and the inflation-adjusted principal.

**Commodities** are great for diversification. Commodities such as energy, agriculture, industrial metals, and livestock protect against inflation. They are not purchased independently; instead, an investor purchases mutual funds or exchange-traded funds for them. These funds will buy and sell agreements to purchase a specific amount of the commodity at an agreed-upon date and price. The arrangements are called futures contracts.

#### Income
Income-oriented assets, fixed-income investments, provide a predetermined amount of money. The fixed-income assets are much less volatile in value than growth assets. The steady income stream they provide is considered safe and can help add stability to a portfolio. They are, however, not entirely risk-free. Despite these assets' consistent income, they can still decline in value.

**International Emerging-Market Bonds** come from governments and companies in emerging markets (markets that are still developing). These bonds offer the potential for capital appreciation and come with more significant risk factors associated with emerging markets, such as political instability and currency fluctuation. Higher yields compensate for the risk factors.

**Preferred Stocks** are a hybrid of stocks and bonds. A company issues them to raise money; therefore, they are not a vehicle of ownership like a common stock. While functioning more like a bond, people trade them on the stock market as common stocks. The primary downside to preferred shares is that "preferred" shareholders get paid after bonds in the event of a default. However, they get paid before common shareholders. A higher yield compensates for this downside. An equity index has a 2 percent yield, whereas preferred shares are commonly between 4 and 6 percent. Since their volatility also sits between bonds and stocks, investors can use them to increase results while mitigating some of the risks of common stocks.

**Bank Loans** are loans made by banks. They are not made for retail investors, however, but for commercial borrowers. Companies sell the loans to investment vehicles, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds. Because the loans pay interest, the funds will pay a floating rate based on a short-term interest rate benchmark. Investors can use these floating rates to hedge against interest rate changes, so many investors buy them for income.

**U.S. High Yield Corporate Bonds** are bonds that offer higher yields than comparable investment-grade bonds. However, they are much riskier because companies issue them with low credit ratings.

**U.S. Investment-Grade Corporate Bonds** are bonds issued by U.S. companies with relatively high credit ratings. These debt securities offer higher yields than U.S. Treasury bonds of comparable maturity. However, they provide lower results compared to high-yield corporate bonds.

**U.S. Securitized Bonds** are debt securities that hard assets or loans support. These include asset-backed securities (ABS), mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and commercial MBS.

**Investment-Grade Municipal Bonds** are generally government bonds issued by local governments smaller than a country, such as cities, states, counties, and public purpose entities (like hospitals and airports). They have a high credit rating and are exempt from federal taxes.

#### Growth and Income
Some asset classes that provide steady income opportunities also have the potential to grow in value, having both high yield and high returns. These classes come with more risk than income-focused asset classes and less risk than growth-oriented classes.

**U.S. High Dividend Stocks** are shares of U.S. companies. What makes these unique is their higher-than-average dividend distribution to their shareholders.

**International High-Dividend Stocks** provide the dividend potential of U.S. High Dividend Stocks but with added diversification to a portfolio by relying on markets independent of the U.S. market.

**U.S. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)** are corporations that own and manage real estate. They are not holding the real estate with the expectation that it will increase in value. Instead, they own and operate these investments to rent them out to tenants. The real estate could be office buildings, shopping malls, nursing homes, apartment complexes, etc. REITs purchase these properties and hire people to manage them. They find tenants for the properties and pass the rent collected to their shareholders. The purpose of REITs is to provide income to shareholders. Therefore, they can offer a higher yield than the stock market.

** International Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)** are REITs in countries outside the U.S., providing diversification, income potential, and protection against inflation.

**Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs)** are publicly traded securities of partnerships. They generate 90% of their income from the production of commodities, oil, natural gas, coal, and activities related to real estate. They offer a tax advantage because cash flows at the company level are not taxed.

#### Growth
Of all asset classes, the highest returns come from stocks. Therefore, when the primary focus of your portfolio is growing, it should have a high percentage of stocks. Equities also have the highest volatility and hence, the highest risk of all asset classes.

**U.S. Large-Company ("Large-Cap") Stocks** are shares which U.S.-based companies with a market capitalization of more than $20 billion issue. They are the most liquid (possessing a high availability of buyers) stocks and generally the most stable.

**U.S. Medium-Company ("Mid-Cap") Stocks** sit between small-cap and large-cap stocks. They are shares issued by U.S.-based companies with a market capitalization of less than $20 billion and more than $2 billion. Their level of risk and return generally sits in a range between large-cap and small-cap stocks.

**U.S. Small-Company ("Small-Cap") Stocks** are shares which U.S.-based companies with a market capitalization of less than $2 billion issue. Small-cap stocks have more room to grow when compared to large-cap stocks, so they have more significant potential for high returns. However, they also have equally high volatility.

**International Developed Large-Company ("Large-Cap") Stocks** are large-cap stocks issued by companies in highly economically developed countries. These provide growth potential similar to that of their U.S. counterparts. The benefit they provide is that the companies are part of an economic system separate from U.S. stocks. Their revenue is much more closely related to their home country's economy. If the U.S. market is doing poorly, that does not necessarily mean the foreign economy is also down, which provides an additional layer of diversification while maintaining the benefits of large-cap stocks. International investments carry additional risk due to several factors they are subject to that U.S. stocks may be less affected by, such as currency fluctuations and political instability.

**International Developed Medium-Company ("Mid-Cap") Stocks** are the international equivalent of U.S. mid-cap stocks. They provide the same benefits as the U.S. stocks while providing additional diversification like the global large-cap stocks.

**International Developed Small-Company ("Small-Cap") Stocks** are issued by small-cap companies in developed markets. Like small-cap U.S. stocks, they offer excellent growth potential and provide diversification to portfolios already containing U.S. small-cap stocks.

**International Emerging-Market Stocks** are issued by companies whose markets are still developing. Developing economies can grow much faster than developed economies because they have much more room to grow. Stocks of companies in developing economies, therefore, can grow much faster. They come with greater risk, though, and they also provide the diversification of a market that performs differently than that of developed markets.

## The Importance of Asset Classes
Having similar characteristics, assets in the same class tend to behave similarly in the marketplace. Investments in different groups reflect different risk and return; therefore, they behave differently from one another. Increasing risk often increases potential returns. Combining asset classes in your portfolio is the best way to increase returns while decreasing risk. You can hold assets with a high return and smooth out your equity curve by holding low-risk investments.
