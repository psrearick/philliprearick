You can't get too far in the financial world without hearing about index funds and ETFs, but what are they?

Before we get into that, let's be clear on a few terms. You probably know what assets and asset classes are, but if not, here is a very high-level view:

> When investing, you are spending money on things you hope will increase in value, which you will sell later. These "things" are assetsâ€”several different types of assets, or asset classes, group assets with common characteristics together. Check out my <g-link to="/blog/asset-classes/">article on asset classes</g-link> for a deeper dive into them.

Your investment portfolio needs to consist of several asset classes, a concept known as diversification. How you divide your portfolio between these assets is called an asset allocation, and it is critical to figure out the best allocation for you. Before looking at the specifics of picking an appropriate allocation, however, you need to know how even to acquire assets.

Most assets, such as equities (stocks), can be purchased individually on the open market. Since the most remarkable growth comes from equities, you should have some in your portfolio. However, equities have excellent upside potential and significant risk associated with them. What if you buy shares of a company and that company goes bankrupt? What if the stock value goes to zero? These are legitimate concerns. Stocks do fail sometimes. A better approach would be to buy shares in many different companies. How many? How diverse should your portfolio be? What if you pick five stocks, and they all fail? The solution to these concerns is investing in large market segments or the entire market. While equities may fail and sectors of the stock market may fail, the market in its entirety will not go to zero. As I'm sure you are aware, the market has crashed before. Several times it has dropped by significant amounts. Every time, however, it has come back. After a substantial crash, the average time it takes to return to its previous level is two years. The longest it has ever taken is five years. It always comes back. So, investing in a stock or even a handful of equities is risky. Investing in the stock market is significantly safer, which, on average, returns between 8% and 12% every year.

How do you invest in the stock market as a whole? By using funds with that specific purpose. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Mutual Funds are pools of individual securities, such as stocks and bonds. Their goal is to offer exposure to various assets and increase diversification. An index is a broad representative portfolio of investment holdings. Institutions construct indices differently, but they are generally weighted lists of stocks that make up a hypothetical portfolio. You cannot invest in indices themselves. However, ETFs and index mutual funds track them. When selecting your asset allocation, for each asset class you choose, there are representative indices for them. You will invest in these to diversify your portfolio and protect yourself from significant drops in individual stocks. This strategy, index investing, was invented by John Bogle, an investor and founder of the Vanguard Group, one of the largest investment firms in the world.

ETFs and mutual funds are very similar. Mutual funds generally have more fees (up to ten times those of ETFs) because fund managers manage them. ETFs, generally, are passively managed, just tracking an index. Investors trade ETFs like stocks on the open market, making them easier to buy with a lower barrier to entry. Some mutual funds have a minimum amount you need to purchase, whereas ETFs do not. You can buy a single ETF or a fractional share of an ETF. Also, ETFs are generally more tax efficient. Both are good options, but most people try to stick to ETFs.

So an ETF is a portfolio of many assets, sometimes entire asset classes. Once you have decided on an asset allocation, pick out ETFs that represent your desired asset classes, and go to your broker and purchase the funds as you have weighted them.
